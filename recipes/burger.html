        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 3 tables spoons of butter</li>
                <li>4 ham burger buns</li>
                <li>burgers</li>
                <li>cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Butter each half of hamburger buns.</li>
                <li>Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Set the skillet aside, reserving grease.</li>
                <li>Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning together in a large bowl; do not overmix. Form into 4 patties. Make a thumbprint in the middle of each patty to keep it from shrinking as it cooks.</li>
